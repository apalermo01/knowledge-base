## Interpreted vs compiled language

**Interpreted**: source code is read by a program called an interpreter (i.e. python.exe) which executes the script / program line-by-line.

Examples: python, PHP, ruby

**compiled**: source code is read by a compiler line-by-line and converted directly into machine code that the cpu can understand. Generally faster than interpreted languages

Examples: C, C++, Go

The big difference between these two is when the source code gets parsed line-by-line. For interpreted languages, the source code is parsed every time the program is run. For compiled languages, the source code is parsed once when the executable is built.
