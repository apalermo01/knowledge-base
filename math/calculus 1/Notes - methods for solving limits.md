## Substitution
Consider $\lim_{x \to a} f(x)$. If $f(x)$ is continuous (i.e. a smooth line) around $a$, then the limit is just $f(a)$


## Handling indeterminate forms
In many problems, direct substitution may result in an indeterminate expression (e.g. $\frac{0}{0}$). These are some techniques that can get the 0 out of the denominator. 

- Factorize the numerator and denominator, see if offending terms get cancelled out
- Rationalize denominator
- Convert expression into a form that contains a sub-expression which we already know the limit of
