Norm = length of a vector in a space. There are several different ways to measure this.

**L0 Norm**

Number of nonzero elements in a vector

**L1 Norm**

manhattan distance or taxicab norm

$$
||x||_1 = |x_1| + |x_2| + ...
$$

**L2 Norm**

Euclidean distance

$$
||x||_2 = \sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2 + ...}
$$
