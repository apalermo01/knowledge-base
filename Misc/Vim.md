## Just a big list of keybindings that I'm trying to memorize


**copy / pasting from clipboard**
`"*p` - paste from the clipboard
`"*y` - copies to the clipboard

- append `g` to any vim motion to move within the _visual_ lines (ex `gj` instead of `j`)

- gq + enter - format paragraph and split everything onto newlines
- ga -> gets the encoding information for any character that the cursor is currently on

- if there's a string equal to the filename, you can open it with gf. use control+6 to go back to file

undo / redo (uses branches) - best to use a plugin to visualize change trees
- g+ = undo
- g- = redo

## string substitution
