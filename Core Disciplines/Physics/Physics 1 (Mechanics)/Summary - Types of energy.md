# Summary of energies 

### Kinetic
$$
\text{K.E.} = \frac{1}{2}mv^2
$$
- energy associated with moving things
- $m$ = mass ($kg$)
- $v$ = velocity ($m/s$)

### Gravitiational Potential
$$
\text{G.P.E} = mgh
$$
- energy associated with height
- $m$ = mass ($kg$)
- $g$ = acceleration due to gravity ($m/s^2$) - applicable only if close to surface of earth
- $h$ = height above ground ($m$)

## Spring Potential
$$
\text{S.P.E} = \frac{1}{2}k(\Delta x)^2
$$
- energy associated with compressing a spring
- $k$ = spring constant (N/m) - physical property of spring
- $\Delta x$ = spring compression ($m$)

## Thermal 

$$
T
$$
- usually encountered with conservation of energy problems that involve friction
to calculate, try finding the work done by friction, using
$$
W = Fd
$$
or
$$
W = \int F \cdot dx
$$
where $F$ is the applicable friction force
