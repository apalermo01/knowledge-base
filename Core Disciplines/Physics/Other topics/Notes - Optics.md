## Lenses

**Lensmaker's equation**
$$
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{i} + \frac{1}{o}
$$
where: 
- $f$ = focal length (pos for converging (aka convex) lenses, neg for diverging (aka concave) lenses)
- $i$ = image distance (pos for right of lens, neg for left of lens)
- $o$ = object distance (pos for left of lens, neg for right of lens)

## Mirrors

## Refraction

**Index of refraction**

$$
\text{index} = n = \frac{c}{v_{medium}} = \frac{\text{speed of light in vacuum}}{\text{speed of light in medium}}
$$
**Snell's law**

$$
n_1 \sin(\theta_1) = n_2 \sin(\theta_2)
$$

**Total internal reflection**


**Diffraction grating**
large number of parallel closely spaced slits. Similar to double slit experiment, but since there are many slits the condition for maximum intensity is very narrow resulting in a higher resolution. 

Diffraction condition:
$$
d \sin(\theta) = m \lambda
$$
**TODO**: diagram

**Double slit interference**
