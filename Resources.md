[learning bash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPwyp2NG-bE&list=PLIhvC56v63IKioClkSNDjW7iz-6TFvLwS&index=1)

[the python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) (this was the primary resource I used when learning python)

[coding bat](https://codingbat.com/python) (some programming exercises for python and java)

[SQL zoo](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial) - great resource for sql tutorials

Most major python libraries have tutorial notebooks that are great for picking up the basics:
