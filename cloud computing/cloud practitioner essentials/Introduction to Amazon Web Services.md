# Cloud compute model


client-server model: use coffee shop analogy<br>
barista: server<br>
customer: client<br>

request may be anything

barista may be an EC2 instance (elastic cloud compute)<br> 
makes request -> validates that it's legit -> sends response<br> 

**You only pay for what you use**<br> 
store owner decides how many baristas are needed, and just pays for those baristas<br> 
you don't prepay for anything and don't worry about capacity<br> 
for onsite servers: you constantly pay for fixed resources whether you use them or not<br>



**cloud computing** - on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing

**undifferentiated heavy lifting of IT** - common, time-consuming, and repetative tasks

## 3 cloud computing deployment models

- cloud-based: all the intensive hardware is remote
- on-premesis: private cloud deployment. Essentially makes resource use more efficient through virtualization
- hybrid - some systems on the cloud, some on-premesis

## Benefits of cloud computing

- variable expenses
- no cost of running / maintaining data centers
- no guessing capacity
- economies of scale
- better speed / agility
- global
