**Definition**

$$
\mathcal{E} = - \frac{d \phi_b}{dt}
$$
What this says: The induced electromotive force (EMF) (aka voltage) is the negative of the rate of change of magnetic flux


## Magnetic Flux

**magnetic flux** = the "amount" of magnetic field passing through a surface (analogous to electric flux)

$$
\phi_B = \vec{B} \cdot \vec{A}
$$
where $\vec{B}$ is the magnetic field vector and  $\vec{A}$ is the area vector. 
`Reminder`: Area vector is a vector perpendicular to a surface and has a magnitude equal to its area. For non-closed surfaces there are 2 possibilities for the direction, for closed surfaces the area vector always points outward.

## Solenoids

For a solenoid, we multiply the change in magnetic flux by the number of turns:


$$
\mathcal{E} = -N \frac{d\phi_B}{dt}
$$
To get the direction of the current, use the right hand rule. Thumb points in the direction of the CHANGE in magnetic field, fingers curl in the direction of the current



## Lenz's Law

The best way to remember Lenz's law is "Conducting coils don't like change". If the magnetic flux in a conducting coil is changing, then the coil will have an induced current which induces a magnetic field that counteracts that changing B field.
