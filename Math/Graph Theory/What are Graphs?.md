A graph is a mathematical object / data structure that is defined by nodes connected by edges. Formally, treat this as a pair of sets $V$ and $E$ where $V$ is the non-empty set of vertices / nodes and $E$ is a set of 2-item subsets of $V$ called edges.

For example, the graph shown below #todo 

has:
$$
V = 
$$
and 
$$
E = 
$$


Some definitions:

- **Adjacent**: Two nodes are *Adjacent* if they are connected by an edge
- **Incidence**: An Edge $E$ is *Incident* to $x_1$ and $x_2$ if $E$ connects $x_1$ and $x_2$
- **Degree**: the *Degree* of a node is the number of edges incident to a node
- **Simple Graph**: A graph is *Simple* if it has no loops or multiple edges
