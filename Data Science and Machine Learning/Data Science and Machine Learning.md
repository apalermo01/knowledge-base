Header section for data science & machine learning. This section is a collection of algorithms / techniques for what I call "classical machine learning" covering everything you might find in scikit-learn, neural net libraries such as pytorch or tensorflow, and a more mathematically intensive description of these algorithms. Other topics and models in statistics will be in the dedicated [[Statistics|Statistics]] section, which will should include [[Bayesian statistics|Bayesian]] and [[Time Series - Header|Time Series]] analysis.

	- [ ] [[Deep learning architectures for NLP]]
	- [ ] [[Language Modeling]]
	- [ ] [[NLP Tasks]]
	- [ ] [[Summary of preprocessing techniques]]
	- [ ] [[Summary of vector space models]]
- [ ] #todo find a home for [[Preprocessing functions]]
- [ ] #todo rewrite [[Fundamentals of Neural Networks]]
- [ ] #todo find a home for [[Classification metrics]] - likely a dedicated folder for evaluation metrics
