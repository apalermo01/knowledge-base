Header section for data science & machine learning. This section is a collection of algorithms / techniques for what I call "classical machine learning" covering everything you might find in scikit-learn, neural net libraries such as pytorch or tensorflow, and a more mathematically intensive description of these algorithms. Other topics and models in statistics will be in the dedicated [[Statistics|Statistics]] section, which will should include [[Bayesian statistics|Bayesian]] and [[Time Series - Header|Time Series]] analysis.
