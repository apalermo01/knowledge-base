## Describe the purpose of Azure arc

- lets you extend azure compliance and monitoring to hybrid and multi-cloud configurations usig Azure Resource Manager (ARM)
- you can:
	- manage entire environment together  -> projects existing non-azure resources into ARM
	- use multi-cloud and hybrid VMs, kuberneters clusters, and dbs as if they're running in azure
	- use familiar azure services
	- keep using traditional ITOps while introducing DevOps practies
	- configure custom locations as an abstraction layer
- can manage the following resource types:
	- servers
	- k8s clusters
	- azure data services
	- sql server
	- VMs (preview)

## Describe Azure Resource Manager and Azure ARM templates

- ARM is the deployment and management service for azure.
- Every request from azure tools, APIs, SDKs, etc. goes through ARM, which authenticates / authroizes the request and then sends the request to the azure service.
- Benefits
	- manage infrastructure through a declarative template
	- deploy, manage, and monitor all resources as a group
	- consistently re-deploy resources throughout the development lifecycle
	- define dependencies
	- apply access control to all services
	- apply tags
	- clarify billing
- ARM templates
	- infrastructure as code: manage infrastructure as lines of code
	- describe resources you want in a declarative json format
	- benefits:
		- declarative syntax
		- repeatable results
		- orchestration
		- modular files
		- extensibility
