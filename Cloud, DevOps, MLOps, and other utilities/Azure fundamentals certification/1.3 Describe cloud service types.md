## Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
- most flexible
- cloud provider is responsible for maintaining hardware, network connectivity, and physical security
- you're repsonsible for everything else
- essentially renting the hardware in a cloud datacenter

- places the largest share of responsibility on the customer
- customer is responsible for installation, configuration, patching, updates, and security
- scenarios:
	- lift-and-shift migration (standing up cloud resources similar to on-prem datacenter)
	- testing and development environments

## Platform as a service (PaaS)
- middle ground between IaaS and SaaS
- cloud provider is responsible for:
	- physical infrastructure
	- physical security
	- connection to internet
	- operating systems
	- middleware
	- dev tools
	- BI services
	
- don't have to worry about licensing / patching

- scenarios:
	- development framework
	- analytics / business intelligence

## Software as a service (SaaS)
- essentially renting or using a fully developed application
- least flexible, but easiest to get up and running
- places most responsibilty on cloud provider
- customer is only responsible for data, device, and users that have access

- scenarios:
	- email and messaging
	- business productivity applications
	- finance and expense tracking
