## Getting started with Azure accounts

![[account structure.png]]

**Azure free account**
- free access to azure products for 12 months
- credit to use for first 30 days
- 25 product that are always free

**Azure free student account**
- free access to certain services for 12 months
- credit ot use in first 12 months
- free access to certain software developer tools

**Microsoft learn sandbox**
- temporary subscription added to azure account
- allows you to create azure resources during a learn module, and automaticallly cleans up the temporary resources after completion
- In the sandbox, you can switch to a bash shell by typing `bash` in the powershell prompt
- ender pwsh to switch back to powershell
- most azure specific commands start with the letters `az`

**Azure commands**

`az version` gets the azure CLI version
`az interactive` enters interactive mode
	`exit` exits interacxtive mode

## Describe Azure physical infrastructure

**physical infrastructure**

- Datacenters - single buildings / facilities with compute resources
- Regions - geographical area that has at least one, but potentially multiple datacenters that are nearby and networked
	- Azure automatically assigns and controls the resources in each region to balance workloads
	- when deploying most kinds of resources, you'll specify the region in which they're to be deployed
	
- availability zone - physically separate datacenters within an Azure region
	- contains one or more datacenters with independent power, cooling, and networking
	- meant to be set up as an isolation boundary
	- connected through private fiber-optic networks
	- **a minimum of 3 separate availability zones are present in all availability zone-enabled regions. Not all regions currently support availability zones**
	- maily used for mission critical applications and building high-availabilty into the application
	- primarily for VMs, managed disks, load balancers, and SQL databases
	- azure services that support availability zones fall into 3 categories:
		- zonal services: pin resource to specific zone (ex: VMs, managed disks, IP addresses)
		- zone redundant services: platform automatically replicates across zones (ex: zone-redundant storage, SQL database)
		- non-regional services: available from all azure geographies and resiliant to zone-wide and region-wide outages
	
- Region Pairs - most regions are paired with another in the same geography (>300 miles apart)
	- if a region is affected by a natural disaster, services would automatically fail over into the other region in the pair
	- not all services do this, recovery and replication for some services are handled by customer
	- additional advantages:
		- one region of every pair is prioritized if both go down
		- planned updates are rollled out to paired regions one region at a time
		- data continues to reside within the same geography as its paid
	- NOTE:
		- qmost regions are paired in 2 directions (e.g. West US and East US back each other up)
		- some are paired in only one direction

- Sovereign Regions
	- instances of azure that are isolated from the main instance of azure. Might want to use this for compliance / legal purpose
	- ex: US DoD Central, US Gov Virginia, China East, China North

## Azure management infrastructure


**Azure resources and resource groups**
- resource = basic building block of azure
- resource groups = groupings of resources. Every resource must be in a resource group. A single resource can only be in one resource group at a time. Resource groups can't be nested.
- set up resource groups in a way that's most useful - many different ways to arrange them.

**Azure subscriptions**

- subscriptions are a unit of management, billing, and scale.
- Allows you to logically organize resource groups.
- Subscriptions link to an account - which is an identity in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)
- An account may have several subscriptions.
- Can use different subscriptions in an account to configure different billing models.
- Can use subscriptions to define boundaries
- 2 types of subscription boundaries:
	- billing boundary
	- access control boundary
- Some examples that you can use subscriptions to separate: environments, organizational structures, billing

**Management groups**
- level of scope above subscriptions
- organize subscriptions into management groups
- apply governance conditions to management groups
- gives enterprise-grade management at scale.
- can be nested
