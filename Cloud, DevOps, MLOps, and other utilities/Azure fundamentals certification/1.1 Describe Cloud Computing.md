## **What is cloud computing**?
- Delivery of computing services over the internet

## **The shared responsibility model**
- responsibility for security, patching, information, etc. is split between consumer and cloud provider
- exactly where that balance is depends on the kind of service
- ![[shared_responsibility_model.png]]

## **Define cloud models**

**private cloud**
- cloud that's used by a single entity
- organizations have complete control over resources / security
- data is not collected with another orgs data
- hardware must be purchased
- organizations are responsible for hardware maitenence / updates

**public cloud**
- built, controlled, and maintained by a 3rd-party provider.
- anyone that wants to can purches services and access resources
- no capital expenditures
- applications can be quickly provisioned and deprovisioned
- pay for waht you use
- orgs don't have complete control over resources and security

**hybrid cloud**
- public and private clouds in an inter-connected environment
- can let a private cloud surge for increased, temporary demand through deploying public cloud services
- most flexible
- orgs determine where to run apps

**multi-cloud**
- use multiple public cloud providers
- also applies to migrating between environments

**Azure arc**
- manages cloud environment

**Azure VMware solution**
- runs vmware workloads in azure (in case you already use VMware in a private cloud)

## Consumption-based model

- 2 types of expense:
	- capital expenditure (CapEx)
		- one-time up front costs (e.g. new building, new company vehicle)
	- operational expenditure (OpEx)
		- spending money on services / products over time
- cloud computing falls under OpEx
	- don't pay for physical infrastructure, power, security, etc.
- cloud pricing models
	- pay-as-you-go
	- essentially, you're renting compute power and storage from some else's datacenter
## review
- cloud computing = delivery of computing services over the internet
- hybrid cloud: some datacenters provide services to anyone that wants them, some datacenters are focused on serving a single customer
- IaaS places the most responsibility on the customer
