## Benefits of high availability and scalability in the cloud
- guarentees a customer a given level of service
- usually have 99%, 99.9%, 99.95%, and 99.99% uptime guarentees
- each azure service has it's own SLA with a different uptime guarentee 

## Scalability
- ability to adjust resources to meet demand
- benefit: you're not overpaying. If demand drops off, you can scale back down
- two varieties: vertical and horizontal

**Vertical scaling**
- add / remove more CPUs or RAM to / from compute resources
- make the compute resources more powerful

**horizontal scaling**
- add extra virtual machines / containers
- add more compute resources

## Benefits of reliability and predictability in the  cloud


**reliability**
- ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function
- one of the pillars of the Well-Architected Framework
- Azure is decentralized by design, so even if one datacenter has a catastrophic failure, other datacenters are still up and running to take on the workload

**performance predictibility**
- focuses on predicting the resources needed to deliver a positive experience for customers
- cloud concepts that support predictability: *autoscaling, load balancing, high availability*

**cost predictibility**
- predicting / forcasting the cost of cloud spend
- track resource use in real time, monitor resources for efficient use, and apply data analytics to find patterns and trends to help better plan resource deployments


## Benefits of security and govenance in the cloud

- set template: help meet corporate standards and regulatory requirements
- cloud-based auditing: flags issues
- software patches and updates can automatically be applied
- cloud providers are normally well suited to handle a range of attacks like DDOS


## Benefits of manageability in the cloud


**Mangement OF the cloud**
- automatically scale resource deployment based on need
- deploy resources based on a preconfigured template, removing the need for manual configuration
- monitor health of resources and automatically replace failing resources
- recieve automated alerts based on configured metrics


**Management IN the cloud**
- through web portal
- through CLI
- through APIs
- through PowerShell
