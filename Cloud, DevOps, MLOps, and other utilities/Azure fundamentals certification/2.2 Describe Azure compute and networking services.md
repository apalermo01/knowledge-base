## Describe Azure Virtual Machines

- infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
- ideal when:
	- you need total control over OS
	- need to run custom software
	- need to use custom hosting configurations

## Scale VMs in Azure

- Virutal machine scale sets
	- create and manage a group of identical, load-balanced VMs
	- automates the identical configuration and network routing of multiple VMs
	- automaticallly deploys a load balancer
- Virtual machine availability sets
	- designed to ensure that VMs stagger kupdates and have varied power / network connectivity
	- group in 2 ways: update domain and fault domain
		- update domain:
			- rebooted at the same time
			- apply updates while knowing that only one group will be offline at a time
			- 30-minutes to recover before maitenence on the next domain starts
		- fault domain:
			- groups by common power source and network switch
			- by default, splits into 3 fault domains
	- no extra charge for availability sets, only charge for the VMs you create

- Examples of when to use VMs
	- testing and development
	- when running apps in the cloud
	- extending datacenter to cloud
	- disaster recovery

## Describe Azure Virtual Desktop

- desktop and application virtualization service that runs in the cloud
- main appeal: separate personal device and compute resources

## Describe Azure containers

- what are containers? 
	- containers are a virtualization environment
	- don't manage an OS
	- more light weight and agile than scaling firtual machines
	- ex: Docker
	- VMs virtualize hardware
	- containers virtualize the OS
- Azure container instances
	- PaaS offering
	- run a container without worring about a virtual machine or adopt any other services

## Describe Azure Functions

- Serverless computing in azure
	- takes care of all server management tasks and just focusing on the application
	- application of managing servers is handled for you
	- abstraction of servers so you don't have to think about infrastructure
- 3 benefits:
	- no infrastructure management
	- scalability
		- can scale from nothing to 10k requests with no configuration
	- only pay for what you use
		- only charged for the time it takes to run the code
- can be stateless or stateful
	- stateless:
		- default
		- behave as is they're restarted every time
	- stateful (aka durable functions)
		- context is passed through the function to track prior activity

## Describe application hosting options

- Azure App Service
	- host web apps, background jobs, mobile back-ends, and RESTful APIs without managing infrastructure
	- types of app services
		- web apps
		- api apps
		- webJobs
		- Mobile apps
	- app service handles:
		- deployment and management
		- securing endpoints
		- scaling
		- load balancing
## Describe Azure Virtual Networking

- virtual networks and subnets with these network capabilities:
	- isolation and segmentation
		- create multiple isolated virtual networks with private IP address space that isn't internet routable.
	- internet communications
		- can assign public IP addresses to a resource or put it behind a public load balancer
	- communicate between azure resources
		- connect resources on virtual networks
		- use service endpoints to connect different resource types
	- communicate with on-premises resources
		- create a network spannig both local and cloud environments through 3 possible mechanisms:
			- point-to-site virtual private network connections -> computer outside org into corporate network
			- site-to-site virtual private networks -> link on-prem VPN gateway to azure VPN gateway. Devices in azure can appear as being on local network
			- Azure ExpressRoute: dedicated private connectivity to azure that doesn't travel over the internet
	- route network traffic
		- custom route tables
		- Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) -> works with Azure VPN gateways, Azure Route Server, or Azure ExpressRoute to propagate on-prem BGP routes to Azure virtual networks.
	- filter network traffic
		- network security groups: azure resources that contain multiple in/outbound security rules
		- Network virtual appliances: specialized VMs for doing network functions such as running a firewall or WAN optimization
	- connect virtual networks
		- use virtual network peering to send traffic over the Microsoft backbone network, never entering the public internet.
- endpoints:
	- public: public IP address that can be accessed from anywhere
	- private: exist within a virtual network and have a prive IP address form within the address space of that network

## Configure network access

- went through tutorial to access a web server on a virtual machine
	- viewed network security group info
	- created a new rule in that group to allow http access over port 80 so we can view it in a web browser

## Describe Azure Virtual Private Networks

- VPN: uses an encrypted tunnel within another network
- connect 2 or more trusted private network over an untrusted network (i.e. public internet)
- VPN gateways
	- Azure VPN gateway instances are deployed in a dedicated subnet of virtual network. Enables:
		- connect on-prem datacenters to virtual networks (site-to-site)
		- connect individual devices to virtual networks (point-to-site)
		- connect between virtual networks (network-to-network)
	- only one VPN gateway in each network
	- 2 VPN types:
		- policy based: specify statically the IP address of packets that should be encrypted through each tunnel
		- route based: IP routing decides which tunnel to use to send a packet
			- preferred method for on-prem devices
			- use for:
				- connections between virtual networks
				- point-to-site connections
				- multisite connections
				- coexistence with ExpressRoute gateway
- High availability scenarios
	- active / standby: typically VPN gateways are deployed in an active/standby configuration. standby instance assumes responsibility for connection without any intervention
	- active / active: asign a public IP for each instance, create tunnels from on-prem devices to each IP address 
	- ExpressRoute failover: configure VPN gateway as a failover path for ExpressRoute connections
	- Zone-redundant gateways: physically and logically separates gateways in a region

## Describe Azure ExpressRoute

- extend on-prem networks to microsoft cloud over a private connection
- don't go over public internet
- features and benefits:
	- connection to cloud services across all regions in a geopolitical region
	- global connectivity with ExpressRoute Global Reach
	- dynamic routing between your network and microsoft via BGP
	- built-in redundancy
- Connectivity to microsoft cloud services
	- direct access to these services in all regions:
		- office 365
		- dynamics 365
		- azure compute services
		- azure cloud services

## Describe Azure DNS

- hosting service for DNS domains - provides name resolution using azure infrastructure.
- benefits:
	- reliability and performance
	- security
	- ease of use
	- customizable virtual networks
	- alias records
- you can't use azure DNS to buy a domain name -. you have to use App Service domains or a 3rd party registrar
