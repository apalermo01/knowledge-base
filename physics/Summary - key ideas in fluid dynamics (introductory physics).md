# Key ideas in fluid dynamics

## Archimedes principle

Bouyant force = weight of displaced fluid

$$
F_g = \rho_{fluid} V_{displaced} g 
$$
For a partially submerged object:
$$
\text{fraction submerged} = f = \frac{V_{fluid}}{V_{obj}} = \frac{\rho_{obj}}{\rho_{fluid}} 
$$
## Continuity equation
The amount of fluid passing one point must be the same as the amount of fluid flowing past another point

$$
Q_1 = Q_2 \rightarrow \rho_1 A_1v_1 = \rho_2 A_2v_2 \rightarrow (\text{constant density}) A_1v_1 = A_2v_2
$$


## Bernoulli's principle
$$
P + \frac{1}{2}\rho v^2 + \rho g h = \text{constant}
$$
