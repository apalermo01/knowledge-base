# Physics Fundamentals



## Vectors / scalars
**scalars** - quantities that have some magnitude (e.g. temperature, speed, total distance travelled)

**vectors**- quantities that have both a magnitude and a direction (e.g. veloctiy, displacement, acceleration, force)

scalar: going 50 mph
vector: going 50 mph Northeast

## Dimensions, dimensional analysis
Most quantities in physics represent a measurement of some quantity- like distance, time, speed, force, energy, etc. Some common units are given below - all given using the metric system:

| quantity | Unit | Symbol |
| ---------| ---- | ------ |
| distance | meters | m |
| time | seconds | s |
| mass | kilograms | kg |
| temperature | celsius or kelvin | $^\circ c$ or K |

There are many other quantities that can be represented as combinations of other quantities. For example, velocity is defined as distance traveled per unit time and has units of meters per second. I like to call the units that make up some derived quantity its *base units*

Some common derived units are given below

| quantity | unit | symbol | base units |
| --- | --- | -- | --|
| Force | Newtons | N | $\text{kg} \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}^2}$ |
| energy | Joules | J | $\text{kg} \frac{\text{m}^2}{\text{s}^2}$ |
| power | Watts | W | $\text{kg} \frac{\text{m}^2}{\text{s}^3}$ |
| acceleration | | | $\frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}^2}$|
| density | | | $\frac{\text{kg}}{\text{m}^3}$ |

Note that there usually multiple ways to write the units of derived quantities. For example, a Joule can be thought of as a kilogram-meter squared per second squared ($\text{kg} \frac{\text{m}^2}{\text{s}^2}$) or a newton-meter ($\text{N}\text{m}$).

When working through the math, it is important to keep track of your units through the calculations, as this can be used as a sanity check for your answers. 



## Coordinate systems and sign conventions
In order to study phenomena in the real world we need to have a point of reference - what is the starting point for a given motion or trajectory? when did the clock start ticking? To establish these reference points and describe positions and orientations relative to this reference point, we use a coordinate system. You have likely already encountered the cartesian coordinate system in algebra class, and this is the one you will likely keep using throughout introductory physics. 

One thing that I've seen lots of students confused on are sign conventions. Take the two different forms of this equation from kinematics:

$$
\Delta y = v_0t + \frac{1}{2}at^2
$$
$$
\Delta y = v_0t - \frac{1}{2}gt^2
$$
Why is one positive and the other negative? Well, the bottom is usually introduced with kinematics / trajectory problems. The negative sign takes into account the fact that gravity is always pointing down with respect to the y-direction. 

Whenever I work problems, I like to assume nothing about the sign of the variables beforehand, so I will always use $\frac{1}{2}at^2$ and then plug in a negative value for the acceleration due to gravity. 




## Relationship between acceleration, velocity, and displacement

(in progress)

velocity = slope of displacement
acceleration = slope of velocity

velocity = area under acceleration plot
displacement = area under velocity plot


## How to think about this course
Most people that take physics aren't physics majors, and don't have any intention of using the material again once the course is done- so what's the value in taking this class? 

My answer to this is that this course is really a course in problem solving. It teaches students how to develop the tools to solve complex problems that they will find in their careers - especially if they go into any field related to STEM. 

Many students don't like this course becuase of that stuck feeling they have when they don't know what to do and they're metaphorically banging their head against a wall trying to figure out what to do. This is actually a good thing. That "stuck" feeling one gets when stuck on a problem is the mental equivalent of feeling a muscle burn during a workout. The more you do it, the easier it becomes, and the better you will get at solving harder and harder problems. The trick is to be consistent. 

## Other tips

this is a collection of tips that have seemed to work for me throughout the years:

- if you get stuck on a problem, spend 15 minutes brainstorming / experimenting with different approaches. Afterwards, either take a peek at the solution to find the next step, spend some time tracing through the full solution, or if you're not ready to give up or you don't have a solutions manual on hand, go do something else for a while and come back to it.
