# Summary of Forces

## Gravity
Calculated by Newton's law of universal gravitation:
$$
F_g = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} \hat{r}
$$
where:
- $G = 6.67 \times 10^{-11} \frac{Nm^2}{kg}$ (constant)
- $m_1$, $m_2$ are the masses of each object ($kg$)
- $r$ is the distance seperating the objects ($m$)
- $\hat r$ is the unit vector pointing along the axis separating the objects 


This equation may be simplified if close to the surface of the earth: 

$$
F_g = mg
$$
Where
- $m$ = mass of object ($kg$)
- $g$ = acceleration due to gravity ($9.81 m/s^2$)

## Spring
Restoring force when compressing or extending springs

$$
F_s = -k\Delta x
$$
Where
- $k$ = spring constant ($N/m$)
- $\Delta x$ = spring stretch / compression ($m$)

## Centripetal 
Force that keeps objects in uniform circular motion
$$
F_c = m\frac{v^2}{r}
$$
Where:
- m = mass of object ($m$)
- $v$ = tangential velocity ($m/s$)
- $r$ = radius of the curve
- **This is always pointed towards the center of the circular path**

## Centrifugal
Ficticious force that acts on bodies in uniform circular motion in the body's reference frame

Take a car going around a corner. In the driver's reference frame, there is a force pointing towards the outside of the turn. This is **centrifugal force**.

In the road's reference frame, the only lateral force acting on the car is the friction force between the road and the tire, which is keeping the car in circular motion. This is the **Centripetal force**

## Friction
Force associated with objects rubbing together
$$
F = \mu N
$$
Where
- $\mu$ = coefficient of friction. This may be kinetic friction ($\mu_k$), static friction ($\mu_s$), or rolling friction ($\mu_r$) (unitless)
- $N$ = normal force


## Normal 
Force that a surface exerts on an object to counteract gravity. Normally, you would set up a free body diagram and solve for normal force based on equations for the net force. 

For flat surfaces, you would frequently set normal force to have the same magnitude as force due to gravity ($N=mg$).

For inclinded surfaces, normal force could also involve the angle of the incline ($N = mg \cos (\theta)$ or $N = mg \sin (\theta)$, depending on the geometry of the problem)

Normal force is ALWAYS perpendicular to the surface

## Tension
Force that can be exerted by ropes, cables, chains, etc. (generally anything that can be pulled taught). You will normally find the tension at the end of a rope- when this is the case the tension always points towards the center of the rope. The tension at the other end of the same rope will have EQUAL MAGNITUDE but OPPOSITE DIRECTION
