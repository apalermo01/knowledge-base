- When dealing with coulomb's law, we were dealing with an interaction between 2 distinct charges
	- challenge: more difficult to deal with forces related to many charges or charged objects of different shapes

- Goal: given that we know something about one charge (call it charge A), can we predict anything about what an arbitrary charge (charge B) passing by will experience? 
	- intuition: we know that if A has a small charge, we'll be dealing with a smaller force, larger charge -> larger force. However, we don't know exactly what that force will be since we're not saying anything about charge B.
