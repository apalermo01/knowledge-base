**Energy**

- *Electronvolts*: sometimes you'll see energy described in terms of electronvolts ($\text{eV}$).This is defined as *The energy gained or lost by a single electron accelerating from rest through an electric potential difference of one volt*. To use the gravitational analogy, think of it as quantifying potential energy as the energy gained / lost when you drop it from a height of 1 meter.
	- conversion: $1 \text{eV} = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \text{J}$
	- Uses the fact that $\text{Electric potential energy} = q \times \text{Electric potential}$
