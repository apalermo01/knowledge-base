Gauss's law related the electric flux through a closed surface to the total charge inside that surface. 

## What is flux? 
Flux is  a measure of how much "stuff" is going through a surface (stuff could be wind, water, electric field, magnetic field, etc.)

Gauss's law states that:

$$
\Phi_{\text{electric, closed surface}} = \frac{q_{\text{enc}}}{\epsilon_0}
$$
where $\Phi$ is the electric flux through a closed surface

If we include the electric field, then:

$$
\oint E \cdot dA = \frac{q_{\text{enc}}}{\epsilon_0} 
$$
## Solving gauss's law problems

1) find a guassian surface (i.e. closed surface) that exploits the geometry of the charge distribution
	- point charge: sphere
	- infinite plane of charge: gaussian pillbox
	- infinite line of charge: gaussian cylinder
2) If the geometry is set up correctly, E should be constant over all A, so we can eliminate the integral
3) calculate $q_{\text{enc}}$, using an expression involving charge density if needed
