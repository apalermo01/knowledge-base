# Simplifying rational and exponential expressions

## key things to remember

- any number to the zero power is 1
	- $x^0 = 1$
	- $1^0 = 1$
	- $0^0 = 1$
	- $1323950293849^0 = 1$
- anything raised to the first power is itself
	- $x^1 = x$
	- $1^1 = 1$
	- $0^1 = 0$
	- $1323950293849^1 = 1323950293849$
- one raised to anything is 1
	- $1^x=1$
	- $1^1 = 1$
	- $1^{2345234524562}=1$


## Key properties of exponents

$$
x^{-a} = \frac{1}{x^a}
$$
$$
x^a \cdot x^b = x^{a+b} 
$$
$$
\frac{x^a}{x^b} = x^{a-b}
$$
$$
(x^a)^b = x^{a \cdot b}
$$
