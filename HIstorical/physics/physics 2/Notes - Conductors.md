**Some important points to remember about conductors**

- another definition of a conductor is a equipotenital surface
- this means that the electric potential is constant EVERYWHERE
- since electric field is the **slope** of electric potential, **THE ELECTRIC FIELD INSIDE A CONDUCTOR IS ZERO**
- If you apply  Gauss's law (see [[Notes - Gauss's Law]]), that will tell you that there are no charges inside a conductor
	- Therefore all charges on a conductor reside on the surface.
