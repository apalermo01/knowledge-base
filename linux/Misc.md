## tmux

- terminal multiplexer - normally I use it for detaching a terminal from a running process.
- run `tmux` in the terminal to start a session
-  `ctrl+b d` to detach from the session
- `tmux attach -t <session id>` to attach to a session (e.g. `tmux attach -t 0`)
- scroll mode: `ctrl+b [` to use the mouse wheel to scroll. Hit `q` to quit
